--- abstract

Anonymity is less discussed in the IETF than for instance security {{RFC3552}} or privacy {{RFC6973}}. This can be attributed to the fact anonymity is a hard technical problem or that anonymizing user data is not of specific market interest. It remains a fact that 'most internet users would like to be anonymous online at least occasionally' {{Pew}}. 

This document aims to break down the different meanings and implications of anonymity on a mediated computer network.
